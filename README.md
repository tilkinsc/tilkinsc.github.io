## About

United States bound. I have been programming for roughly 11+ years as a hobby without university or job experience, and I prefer to term it `Generalist Programmer`. My favorite languages are C, C++, Lua, Asm (mips), and Java. I've done most of my work on Windows with linux VM support, if needed. I have experience with the embedded systems: RBPI3+, PSP, GBA, and DS. I can code in over 15 different languages, but I feel most comfortable with probably 10 of them.

I never went to school for anything IT / Computer Science. I do have a certification that says I know how to setup networks (advancedly), build computers, fix and use printers, exercise physical security, manage storage media, and some other things that require driver and IT-support skills. However, I am more of a software lover than a hardware one.

You will find I am very pedantic when it comes to formatting of my source. I will not use CLANG formatting. I will not. The source files must be clean, tabbed properly, and align correctly without using an ample amount of tabs (never spaces!). Extra whitespace on ends of lines or between first and last parameters in functions make me go crazy. The tab standard is 4 spaces. I always enjoy helping repos who aren't native English translate or fix up their readmes.

Makefiles aren't my cup of tea. They are overly verbose and not dynamic. Simplicity says tell me the operating system, and it also says let me control my source directory tree with cross platform commands. However, most people are bad enough at make so its okay to get away with dumping all your compiled files in the src directory, I guess. I took the liberty of cobbling together a build script that uses lua. This is where I tell you I am a masochistic programmer - at least I am able to endure long tasks. I reap the benefits of it though :)

My first coding practices were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I moved on to Java and spent about 4+ years there. Java is a nice language when you are dealing with complex libraries not suitable for scripts (servers, signed byte processing, string work). I briefly touched many languages during this learning time too. Some are Actionscript, ASP, PHP, NSIS and C++. I continued with PHP and learned some MySQL on the way to making minecraft [bukkit.org](http://bukkit.org/) plugins. I started learning C and wrote a few applications/games for the GBA then PSP all after learning OpenGL+OpenAL with [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org). Closing in on today, I started work on OS development which was my intro to assembly followed by programming MIPS for the PSP then back to OS development.

My learning never stops. I am practicing digital art as well as digital sound, whether it comes to sound effects or music. It is part of the indy game dev theme. I have a certain interest in pixel art as well as simplex and complex sound effect creation.

I also stream irregularly.

## Activity Log
____

> _[06/15/2019]_ - Started work on a command line program targeted at windows which allows me to spell check words from multiple dictionaries. It uses the CPO library. It is an example of the power it contains in practice, where non-standard argument passing is a thing. Also updated the CPO library to return a new status of current argument where the argument is empty, which supports stdin. Updated LuaConsole accordingly to start enabling stdio passing again.

> _[06/14/2019]_ - LuaConsole now implements my CPO library. The CPO library has been updated to bring extensibility by being able to copy over the saved data for later in-program use. It was a required change to adhere to LuaConsole's function calling, as it didn't have the symbols it needed at the time. I also overhauled how switch parameters worked in LuaConsole to adhere with the CPO library. Needless to say, it is more performant and better looking to the eyes.

> _[05/10/2019]_ - LuaConsole is now fully isolated between Windows/Linux/Mac. Mac build continues to fail due to lack of tooling on travis.ci (lack of version-released tooling). However, should fully work on an actual box with an updated gcc toolchain. Objcopy is mandatory. Setting up windows build in progress.

> _[05/10/2019]_ - CPO library now in z80 assembler, with noticable benefits.

> _[05/09/2019]_ - Bug fixed my personal CPO library. It's a library which hastens and optimizes the switching and flow process of command line applications. It also contains file pointers and stdin so the user doesn't have to buffer load anything, especially stdin. And finally you can switch with whatever operators - / -- you want as well as map many names to one specific function.

> _[05/02/2019]_ - Helped https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live correcting their English in README.md

> _[05/01/2019]_ - z80 assembler has now evolved past emitting only the header
