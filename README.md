## About

United States bound. I have been programming for roughly 10+ years as a hobby without school experience, and I prefer to term it `generalist programmer`. My favorite languages are C, Lua, Asm, and Java. While I've done most of my work on Windows with linux porting but, I have experience with the embedded systems RBPI3+, PSP, GBA, and DS. I can code in around 15 different language, but I feel most comfortable with probably 10 of them.

You will find I am very pedantic when it comes to formatting of my source. I will not use CLANG formatting. I will not. The source files must be clean, tabbed properly, and align correctly without using an ample amount of tabs (never spaces!). Extra whitespace at ends of lines or between first and last parameters in functions make me go crazy. Tab standard is 4.

Makefiles aren't my cup of tea. They are overly verbose and not dynamic. Simplicity says tell me the dang operating system, and it also says let me control my source directory tree with cross platform commands. However, most people are bad enough at make so its okay to get away with dumping all your compiled files in the src directory I guess. I took the liberty of cobbling together a build script that uses lua. This is where I tell you I am a masochistic programmer - at least I am able to endure long tasks. I reap the benefits of it though :)

My first coding practices were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I moved on to Java and spent about 4+ years there. Java is a nice language when you are dealing with complex libraries not suitable for scripts (servers, signed byte processing, string work). I briefly touched many languages during this time too. Some are Actionscript, ASP, PHP, NSIS and C++. I am not a fan of C++ because how verbose and hard to read it is. I continued with in PHP and learned some MySQL on the way to making minecraft [bukkit.org](http://bukkit.org/) plugins. I started learning C and wrote a few applications/games for the GBA then PSP after learning OpenGL with [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org). Closing in on today, I started work on OS development which was my intro to assembly followed by programming MIPS for the PSP then back to OS development.
