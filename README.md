## About

United States bound. I have been programming for roughly 10+ years as a hobby without university or job experience, and I prefer to term it `generalist programmer`. My favorite languages are C, Lua, Asm (mips), and Java. I've done most of my work on Windows with linux VM support if needed. I have experience with the embedded systems: RBPI3+, PSP, GBA, and DS. I can code in over 15 different languages, but I feel most comfortable with probably 10 of them.

You will find I am very pedantic when it comes to formatting of my source. I will not use CLANG formatting. I will not. The source files must be clean, tabbed properly, and align correctly without using an ample amount of tabs (never spaces!). Extra whitespace on ends of lines or between first and last parameters in functions make me go crazy. The tab standard is 4 spaces. I always enjoy helping repos who aren't native English translate or fix up their readmes.

Makefiles aren't my cup of tea. They are overly verbose and not dynamic. Simplicity says tell me the operating system, and it also says let me control my source directory tree with cross platform commands. However, most people are bad enough at make so its okay to get away with dumping all your compiled files in the src directory I guess. I took the liberty of cobbling together a build script that uses lua. This is where I tell you I am a masochistic programmer - at least I am able to endure long tasks. I reap the benefits of it though :)

My first coding practices were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I moved on to Java and spent about 4+ years there. Java is a nice language when you are dealing with complex libraries not suitable for scripts (servers, signed byte processing, string work). I briefly touched many languages during this time too. Some are Actionscript, ASP, PHP, NSIS and C++. I continued with PHP and learned some MySQL on the way to making minecraft [bukkit.org](http://bukkit.org/) plugins. I started learning C and wrote a few applications/games for the GBA then PSP after learning OpenGL with [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org). Closing in on today, I started work on OS development which was my intro to assembly followed by programming MIPS for the PSP then back to OS development.
